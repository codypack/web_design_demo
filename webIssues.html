<h1>Three critical web development issues</h1>

When you develop a web application, you should be aware of three issues. They are:
<ul>
<li><a href="#cbc">cross-browser compatibility</a></li>
<li><a href="#ua">user accessibility</a></li>
<li><a href="#seo">search engine optimization</a></li>
</ul> 
<p>

<h2><a id="cbc">Cross-browser compatibility</a></h2>

If you want your website to be used by as many visitors as possible, you need to make sure that your web pages are compatible with as many browsers as possible.That's known as cross-browser compatibility.That means you should test your applications on as many browsers as possible.

<h2><a id="ua">User accessibility</a></h2>

The second major issue is user accessibility or just accessibility. This refers to the qualities that make a web site accessible to as many users as possible, especially disabled users. For instance, visually impaired users may not be able to read text that's in images so you need to provide alternatives for them.

<h2><a id="seo">Search engine optimization</a></h2>

Search engine optimization, or SEO, refers to the goal of optimizing your website so your pages rank higher in search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. The title and meta elements in the head section of an HTML document are some of the important elements for SEO.
